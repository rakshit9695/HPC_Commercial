Renewable Energy Optimization System for HPC Data Centers

Introduction
This document outlines the functionality of a Python-based system designed to optimize the integration of renewable energy sources into a Hybrid Power Plant (HPP), which supplies power to High-Performance Computing (HPC) Data Centers. These data centers operate at a constant 100% utilization, creating a need for reliable and efficient energy management. The system models the power flow from wind and solar sources into the HPP, accounts for losses and fluctuations, manages battery storage, and minimizes dependency on the electrical grid using optimization algorithms.

System Overview
Renewable Energy Sources
1. Wind Power: Variable power generation modeled over time.
2. Solar Power: Solar irradiance-based power input modeled by hour/day.
Combined to represent total renewable inflow to the system.

Hybrid Power Plant (HPP)
Acts as the central unit where power from wind and solar sources is aggregated.
Connected directly to:
1. Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)
2. The Grid
3. The HPC Data Center

Power Inflow Calculation
- Aggregates total input power from wind and solar.
- Models temporal variability and intermittency of sources.
- Computes effective inflow available for use.

Transmission and Conversion Losses
- Simulates power losses due to transmission infrastructure.
- Includes inverter and transformation losses.
- Adjusts net available power post-loss.

Battery System
- Charges using surplus power when HPC demand is lower than renewable input.
- Discharges to support HPC demand when renewable input is insufficient.
- Maintains efficiency and avoids overcharging or deep discharging.

HPC Data Centers
- Modeled with a fixed demand profile at 100% utilization.
- High and constant energy requirements.
- Acts as a constant load in the system.

Grid Interaction
- Used as a fallback when renewables and battery cannot meet HPC demand.
- Goal is to reduce this dependency as much as possible.

Optimization Algorithms
- Determine ideal power routing to:
- Maximize use of renewable sources.
- Optimize battery charge/discharge cycles.
- Minimize energy drawn from the grid.

Can include:
- Linear programming
- Heuristic-based methods
- Constraint-based optimization

Objectives
- Efficiently utilize renewable energy.
- Optimize energy flow to HPC Data Centers.
- Minimize operational costs and environmental impact.
- Increase energy autonomy and reduce grid reliance.

Summary
This system simulates and optimizes the energy flow from renewable sources through a hybrid infrastructure into an HPC data center environment. The consistent demand of HPC loads makes energy optimization critical, and this system provides a basis for intelligent energy management using simulations, loss modeling, battery logic, and optimization algorithms.
