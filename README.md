The first and foremost outlook is modelling the codestack to incorporate the wind power generation…

Mathematical modeling reveals wind farms operate at capacity factors of 26-35%, governed by Betz's law and Theoretical Wind Equations - 
Doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs) and full-power converters enable grid compatibility.
Transmission losses follow - P = I^2 . R law

Utilizing Perplexity to Cite Sources for Data below, considering this as feasible data I am moving forward and modelling the wind farms.

1. Current Wind Power Generation and Practicality in Canada
1.1 Installed Capacity and Generation Output
    Canada's wind energy sector has grown exponentially, with key statistics:
    18.4 GW total installed capacity (2024), producing 39.06 TWh annually115
    6% of national electricity demand met by wind1518
    Provincial leaders:
    Alberta: 5,715 MW (31%)
    Ontario: 5,532 MW (30%)
    Quebec: 4,072 MW (22%)1718
    Capacity factors vary regionally:
        Capacity Factor=Actual Output (MWh)Installed Capacity (MW)×8,760 hours×100%
        Capacity Factor=
        Installed Capacity (MW)×8,760 hours
        Actual Output (MWh)
        ×100%
        Ontario: 26% (2010-2018 average)7
        Alberta: 34.5% (2017 peak)7
        National average: 30.1% (2022)16

1.2 Practical Considerations
    Economic Viability:
    Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) for wind: $30-60 CAD/MWh, cheaper than fossil alternatives4
    2023 investments: $30B committed for 15 GW planned projects219
    Technical Challenges:
    Intermittency requires 330 MW energy storage (2024) for grid stabilization14
    Transmission bottlenecks in remote regions (e.g., Prairie provinces)6
    Policy Drivers:
    Net-zero 2050 mandate under Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act
    2030 Emissions Reduction Plan targeting 40-45% GHG cuts from 2005 levels.
