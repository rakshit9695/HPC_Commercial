This image is a power source breakdown plot for your HPC data center over a 24-hour period, specifically showing how much 
of the data center’s power demand is met by solar energy versus the electric grid.

Interpretation --
 
Nighttime (Before ~6 AM & After ~6 PM): 
    The data center is entirely dependent on the grid (gray area covers the full demand).
    Solar contribution is zero (no orange area).

Daytime (Roughly 6 AM to 6 PM):
    Solar power ramps up after sunrise, quickly offsetting a large portion of the data center’s demand.

Midday:
    The entire area under the blue line is orange, meaning 100% of the data center’s power is supplied by solar.
    Grid power drops to zero during these hours.

Late afternoon/evening:
    Solar contribution tapers off as the sun sets; the grid again picks up the load.

Transition Periods (Dawn/Dusk):
    Both solar and grid contribute, but solar only partially offsets the demand.
    The orange area grows/shrinks as the sun rises/sets.

Noise/Fluctuations:
    Minor jaggedness in the blue line reflects realistic demand variations and solar output noise.
