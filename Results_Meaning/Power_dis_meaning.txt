This image is a stacked area chart showing the **power distribution of an HPC data center over a 24-hour period** (from midnight April 18 to midnight April 19, 2025).

Dominant Power Consumers:
    GPU(orange) is by far the largest contributor, followed by
    Cooling(purple) and
    CPU(blue).
    Storage and Network are relatively minor contributors.

Daily Pattern: 
    The total power consumption fluctuates in a smooth, sinusoidal manner, peaking and dipping over the course of the day.
    This reflects the simulated utilization pattern (60–90%) you set, which varies throughout the day to mimic realistic data center workload cycles.

Component Stability:**  
    CPU and GPU bands are relatively stable but show slight undulations in sync with the utilization curve.
    Cooling power (purple) rises and falls in tandem with total IT load, as more cooling is needed when the data center is busier.
    Other Infrastructure** (brown) sits on top, showing a relatively small but consistent contribution.

Noise/Spikes:
    Small, rapid fluctuations (spikes) in the bands, especially in storage and network, are due to the random noise component added to utilization and power models to simulate real-world variability.

Summary Statement
    This plot visually demonstrates how different subsystems contribute to the total power draw of an HPC data center throughout a day. The GPU load dominates, cooling closely tracks the IT load, and all components collectively drive the facility’s power demand, which follows a realistic, time-varying pattern as configured in your simulation code.
