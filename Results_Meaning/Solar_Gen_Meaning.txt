This image is a line plot showing the solar power 
generation profile for your simulated solar farm over a 24-hour period (from midnight April 18 to midnight April 19, 2025).

Interpretation
Nighttime (Before ~6 AM & After ~6 PM):
    Solar generation is zero—the line sits at the bottom of the chart, indicating no sunlight and thus no power produced.

Morning (Around 6 AM):
    The line begins to rise sharply, showing the sunrise effect as the solar panels start generating electricity.

Daytime (6 AM to 6 PM):
    Solar output increases rapidly after sunrise, peaking around midday (12–1 PM).
    The output fluctuates between 50–60 MW at its highest, reflecting both the solar farm’s capacity and realistic day-to-day variability (the jaggedness/noise is due to simulated cloud cover or atmospheric effects).
    After midday, the output gradually decreases as the sun lowers in the sky.

Evening (After 6 PM):
    The line drops steeply back to zero, showing sunset and the end of solar generation for the day.
