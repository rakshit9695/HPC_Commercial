1. Solar Integration Effectiveness
    Average Solar Offset: 54.1% of the data center's power needs were met by solar energy during the simulation period.
    Peak Solar Offset: 100% solar coverage was achieved at times, demonstrating the potential for full renewable energy reliance during peak solar generation hours.
    Carbon Savings: Solar power reduced emissions by 86,119 kg CO₂, while grid reliance resulted in 4,305 kg CO₂ emissions.
    Recommendation: Add 1–2 more solar farms to increase average solar offset to 75–90%.
                    Integrate battery storage to store excess solar energy for nighttime/cloudy periods.

2. Energy Consumption Profile
    Average Power: 1,934.6 kW (≈1.9 MW)
    Peak Power: 2,197.4 kW (≈2.2 MW)
    Implications: The data center operates at ~88% of peak capacity on average, indicating high utilization.
                Power spikes suggest opportunities for load balancing or dynamic power capping to reduce peaks.

3. Environmental Impact
    Solar Contribution: Avoided 86,119 kg CO₂ (95% of total potential emissions).
    Remaining Emissions: 4,305 kg CO₂ from grid power during low solar availability.
    Next Steps: Transition to a 100% renewable grid (e.g., Canadian hydroelectric) to eliminate residual emissions.
            Explore waste heat recycling to improve PUE and reduce cooling needs.

4. Comparison to Industry Benchmarks
    Solar Offset:
        Current: 54.1% (good)
        Industry leaders: Google/Apple achieve 70–90% renewable coverage.

    Carbon Intensity:
        Current: ~0.22 kg CO₂/kWh (grid mix)
        Target: 0.0 kg CO₂/kWh with full renewables.

5. Cost Implications
    Savings: Solar reduced grid energy costs by 54% (assuming $0.10/kWh grid vs. $0.03/kWh solar LCOE).
    Payback Period: A 38.9 MW solar farm cost along with the Data Center (deployment cost) --> ~$58M (at $1.5/W). 
        With 54% offset, payback occurs in 6–8 years.
